A basic attendance system designed for just a single admin to handle.
The backend uses flask and the front end is react.

To start the flask server after having cloned the repo.

First, create a virtual env so you don't install things you may not need. 
python -m venv AttendanceApp

Then activate the venv and start the flask app with 
python flask_app.py

The server runs on localhost port 5000.

Development is still ongoing and this README will be updated accordingly.
